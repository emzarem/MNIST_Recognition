# MNIST_Recognition

This code was written while following along with the examples found in Michael Nielsen's online book
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

As such all credit for original Neural Net design and implementation goes to Michael Nielsen.
His works can be found here:

This is my implementation of his MNIST classifier code showcased in his online book and hosted on his Github.

I have added a number of features in my implementation to make it more helpful for learning neural nets, including visualisation
and the ability to use the classifier on your own supplied images.
